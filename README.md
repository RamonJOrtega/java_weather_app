##Java Weather App

This application was built in the JGrasp IDE as my final project #15 in my Introduction to Java Programming Class.
Note: .gitIgnore ignores projects #1-#14 which house other learning applications from the Java Programming Class.
You will need to setup a Derby Database to run this code, but you may update the code with your choice of database (such as Railway).
The application reads national weather service API from the web, stores it in the Derby Database, and returns flight conditions when queried by the user.
Flight conditions include location, date, time, windspeed, direction, temperature, etc.

To run the File:
1. Clone the repository to a folder on your local machine.
2. Open that folder.
3. Open the [A19015.java](https://github.com/RamonJustisOrtega/java_weather_app/blob/main/A19015.java) file in your favorite IDE.
Make sure you have Language Support For Java (or equivelent).
4. Click the RUN button.

You will be able to:
1. Clear the Derby Database
2. Download flight conditions from the web.
3. Update the Derby Database with the web data.
4. Update the Derby Database with station names.
4. Clear and Load the ComboBox searches with the new Derby Database Data.
