   This function is the main method for the A19012 class. It instantiates a WeatherForm12 object, thereby
   running a program that takes weather and airport data from the internet, stores them into .txt files, reads
   those .txt files, puts the read data into a data base, and looks up data from that database to tell the user
   airport status and weather. The interface uses comboboxes an buttons
